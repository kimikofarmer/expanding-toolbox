# expanding-toolbox

This example demonstrates using Sass.

A web developer would want to use this technology because Sass lets you use features that don't currently exist in CSS. For example, variables, nesting, mathematical operators and inheritance. These tools make coding CSS easier and more organized. The Sass file then saves it out as a regular CSS file to use for your website or application.

By looking at the complaints of Sass online, a web developer might be cautious about using this because then their entire team would have to be on board switching to this language. Also, if you are using Sass then people claim that you develop sites upon a framwork, not upon the solid knowledge of CSS. For me, the biggest thing that bugged me was that the ending curly brace stays on the last line of CSS code for the element, instead of on the line below.

My example site is a front page for my sorority's website that I mocked-up for this assignment (http://students.washington.edu/kimikof/info343/challenges/expanding-toolbox/). When looking at the test.scss file, which shows using Sass, I used variables, nesting, and importing another .scss file. It demonstrates how these tools are really useful in writing CSS. For example, being able to create a variable for hex codes is a way to simplify applying color to different elements because you don't have to remember the hex code or go back and copy and paste it to different elements. Importing is also valuable in that it is a nice way to organize your CSS. You can have different .scss files when writing them to separate what the CSS is for, but when importing them it all ends up in the same CSS file for your page. I also demonstrate the use of mathematical operators (in #mainBody), which may be useful in certain coding situations. I also demonstrate Sass functions, like 'darken'.

My example does not need any additional tools or frameworks to run. Sass saves out our preprocessed files as regular CSS files. To make any changes to the .scss file and have it change the .css file though, you will need to enter the terminal, install ruby if it is not already on your computer, install sass, and run several commands which are written out in the web pages I linked below.

has a good tutorial for absolute beginners. It shows you how to install it on your computer and has sample files to test out Sass.
Sass also provides basic syntax on their website,
